Resources for tracking PL-300 exam study progress

This repo contains the resources I used to track my progress as I was preparing for Exam PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst

Please note that the exams are updated every few months where they can get new skills or some skilles may get removed. Always check the official study guide. The Excel sheet that I have may be outdated by the time you download it.

There followint resources in this repo:

    1. An Excel file that I created using the offical study guide: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/pl-300
    2. A Power BI file that is based on the Excel file above. I used this Power BI file to summarize my progress.

The Excel file and Power BI file work together. Download both files and then point the Power BI data source to where the Excel file is located by going to Transform Data --> Data Souce Setting --> Refresh.

Here is a link to my YouTube video on tips and tricks on passing DP-700: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om0kJ2fbmko. I will post a video for PL-300 in future.
